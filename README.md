## Learn something collaboratively - Machine Learning

__Machine learning__
Building a model from example inputs to make data driven prediction vs. following strictly static program instructions. Mainly system learns how to solve a problem from example data rather than following a specific logic written with branching statements.
## In traditional programming
__We__ carefully analyses the problem and __write code__, this program then reads data then __uses control logic__ we wrote carefully and determines correct part of the program to execute, which eventually produce end results.

__Traditional control logic__

If, switch case, for, while, etcâ€¦

## In Machine learning
__We__ gather a dataset from a problem domain, and __pre-process__ it in to a form where machine learning algorithm can understand. Then we feed the data to an __algorithm__ which analyses the data and produce a __model__ . This __model__ implements the solution to resolve the problem based on the data.
__the initial data we used drives the prediction logic, not a logic written by a programmer.__
## How can an Algorithm learn it self ?

## We will be useing Azure ML Studio to get-in to basics

__Why ML studio__

Azure Machine Learning Studio is a __collaborative, drag-and-drop tool__ you can use to __build, test, and deploy__ predictive analytics solutions on your data. Tutorials, videos, and example models show you how to use Studio to build and deploy machine learning models.

## we will be focusing mainly on machine learning flow, and the algorithm selection

__Machine learning flow__

__Asking the right question > Preparing data > Selecting the algorithm > training the model > testing the model__

We have prepared some data sets here to begin with,

![Diabetes-dataset](https://github.com/rangasurendra/evening-brew-ml/blob/master/files/datasets/blood-suger/diabetes.csv)

![Function-approximation](https://github.com/rangasurendra/evening-brew-ml/blob/master/files/datasets/function-approximation-cos/cos-function.csv)

![kickstarter-projects-success](https://github.com/rangasurendra/evening-brew-ml/blob/master/files/datasets/kickstarter-projects/kick-2016.csv)

![interview-attendence](https://github.com/rangasurendra/evening-brew-ml/blob/master/files/datasets/will-they-come-to-interview/Interview.csv)

Each team will be given a data set which they needs to analyse using ML studio, and needs to present it to the crowed with the findings.
