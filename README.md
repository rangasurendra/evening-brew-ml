## Learn new technology - Machine Learning

__Machine learning__
Building a model from example inputs to make data driven prediction vs. following strictly static program instructions. Mainly system learns how to solve a problem from example data rather than following a specific logic written with branching statements.
## Traditional programming
__We__ carefully analyses the problem and __write code__, this program then reads data then __uses control logic__ we wrote carefully and determines correct part of the program to execute, which eventually produce end results.
__Traditional control logic__
If, switch case, for, while, etcâ€¦
__In Machine learning__
__We__ gather a dataset from a problem domain, and __pre-process__ it in to a form where machine learning algorithm can understand. Then we feed the data to an __algorithm__ which analyses the data and produce a __model__ . This __model__ implements the solution to resolve the problem based on the data.
__the initial data we used drives the prediction logic, not a logic written by a programmer.__
